## Qualifier Annotation
Like @Primary, the @Qualifier annotation gives priority to one bean over
the other if two beans of the same type are found. The bean whose name 
is specified in the @Qualifier annotation qualifies to be injected as
a dependency. The @Qualifier annotation can be used in a scenario when
we have multiple objects of the same type and autowiring by name cannot
be used because the variable name doesnâ€™t match any bean name.

Add below before the bean class defination
@Component
@Qualifier("<name>")

Add before interface
@Autowired
@Qualifier("<name>")
private Filter filter;

## The @Qualifier annotation takes precedence over the @Primary annotation
