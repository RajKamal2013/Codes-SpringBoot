## Recommender System 
A recommender system is a system that filters some entities based on the 
userâ€™s history. 
Recommender systems also rank these items based on user preferences. 
The system works by taking an input and then finding items similar 
to that input.

1. Content Based 
2. Recommender Based 
## Content Based 
Content-based filtering in which item-to-item similarity is used as a 
basis for finding matches. So, for a movie like Finding Dory, 
the system will find movies of the same genre, 
like Happy Feet, Ice Age, Shark Tale, etc
